**Agent:** v7  
**Episode ID:** ep_20260510_115059_data_plane_degradation  
**Date:** 2026-05-10T11:51:01.315983+00:00  
**Duration:** 165.1s  

---

## Scenario

**Category:** network  
**Blast radius:** single_nf  
**Description:** Inject 30% packet loss on the UPF. RTP media streams will degrade, voice quality drops. Tests whether the stack detects and reports data plane quality issues.

## Faults Injected

- **network_loss** on `upf` — {'loss_pct': 30}

## Baseline (Pre-Fault)

Stack phase before injection: **ready**
All containers running at baseline.

## Fault Propagation Verification

**Verdict:** ✅ `confirmed`

- **Wait:** 0s
- **Actual elapsed:** 0.0s
- **Nodes with significant deltas:** 5
- **Nodes with any drift:** 5

## Symptoms Observed

Symptoms detected: **Yes**  
Observation iterations: 1

## Anomaly Screening (Phase 0)

**ANOMALY DETECTED.** Overall anomaly score: 56.69 (per-bucket threshold: 26.31, context bucket (0, 1), trained on 323 healthy snapshots). The current metric pattern is statistically different from the learned healthy baseline. Something in the network has changed.

The following metrics deviate from their learned-healthy baseline. Treat each as a semantic observation (meaning + numbers), not a number alone — the KB's interpretation is the authoritative reading.

- **`derived.rtpengine_loss_ratio`** (RTPEngine RTCP-reported per-RR average packet loss) — current **26.67 packets_per_rr** vs learned baseline **0.00 packets_per_rr** (MEDIUM, spike)
    - **What it measures:** Live measure of media-plane packet loss as observed by
the far end of each call (via RTCP RRs) and aggregated
into per-RR mean. Zero during healthy traffic regardless
of call volume; rises when receivers report missing
packets. Magnitude scales with loss intensity, so a
higher value indicates more packets lost per report.
    - **Spike means:** Receivers are reporting packet loss back to rtpengine.
Could be loss on the rtpengine container's egress
(iptables / tc / interface congestion), loss anywhere
upstream of the receiver, or — with simultaneous UPF
counter degradation — loss on the N3 path.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 0–0.1 packets_per_rr

- **`normalized.icscf.core:rcv_requests_invite_per_ue`** (SIP INVITE rate per UE at I-CSCF) — current **0.01 requests_per_second** vs learned baseline **0.00 requests_per_second** (MEDIUM, spike)
    - **What it measures:** Health of call-setup forwarding P-CSCF → I-CSCF. Partition signature
same as REGISTER rate.
    - **Spike means:** Forwarding failure.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 0–0.2 requests_per_second
    - **Healthy invariant:** Per-UE rate. Tracks pcscf.invite rate.

- **`normalized.icscf.core:rcv_requests_register_per_ue`** (SIP REGISTER rate per UE at I-CSCF) — current **0.01 requests_per_second** vs learned baseline **0.06 requests_per_second** (MEDIUM, drop)
    - **What it measures:** Health of the P-CSCF → I-CSCF forwarding path (Mw interface). When
this drops to zero while P-CSCF REGISTER rate is still non-zero,
it's the SIGNATURE of an IMS partition between P-CSCF and I-CSCF.
    - **Drop means:** Either UEs not registering at all, or P-CSCF isolated from I-CSCF.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 0–0.5 requests_per_second
    - **Healthy invariant:** Per-UE rate. Should closely track ims.pcscf.rcv_requests_register_per_ue.

- **`normalized.pcscf.core:rcv_requests_invite_per_ue`** (SIP INVITE rate per UE at P-CSCF) — current **0.04 requests_per_second** vs learned baseline **0.00 requests_per_second** (MEDIUM, spike)
    - **What it measures:** Call attempt rate from registered UEs. Unlike REGISTER (periodic),
INVITEs only fire when UEs place calls. Zero is normal during
quiet periods; nonzero INVITE with zero dialogs is the signature
of call setup failure.
    - **Spike means:** Fewer call attempts.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 0–0.2 requests_per_second
    - **Healthy invariant:** Per-UE rate.

- **`normalized.pcscf.core:rcv_requests_register_per_ue`** (SIP REGISTER rate per UE at P-CSCF) — current **0.01 requests_per_second** vs learned baseline **0.06 requests_per_second** (MEDIUM, drop)
    - **What it measures:** How actively UEs are refreshing their IMS registrations with the
P-CSCF. REGISTERs arrive periodically (re-registration timer) plus
at attach. Sustained zero means UEs cannot reach P-CSCF OR the
UE-to-network SIP path is broken.
    - **Drop means:** No REGISTERs flowing. Unusual unless UEs are all deregistered.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 0–0.5 requests_per_second
    - **Healthy invariant:** Per-UE rate — same value at any deployment scale.

- **`normalized.scscf.cdp_replies_per_ue`** (S-CSCF CDP Diameter replies per UE) — current **0.01 replies_per_second_per_ue** vs learned baseline **0.06 replies_per_second_per_ue** (MEDIUM, drop)
    - **What it measures:** Active S-CSCF Diameter traffic with HSS. Near-zero when registrations idle OR HSS partition.
    - **Drop means:** No active S-CSCF Diameter exchanges (idle or partitioned).
    - **Healthy typical range:** 0–1 replies_per_second_per_ue
    - **Healthy invariant:** Per-UE rate; varies with registration/auth load.

- **`normalized.scscf.core:rcv_requests_invite_per_ue`** (SIP INVITE rate per UE at S-CSCF) — current **0.03 requests_per_second** vs learned baseline **0.00 requests_per_second** (MEDIUM, spike)
    - **What it measures:** S-CSCF participation in call setup. Zero when calls aren't being
placed OR S-CSCF not receiving forwarded INVITEs.
    - **Spike means:** Upstream forwarding issue.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 0–0.2 requests_per_second
    - **Healthy invariant:** Per-UE rate.

- **`normalized.scscf.core:rcv_requests_register_per_ue`** (SIP REGISTER rate per UE at S-CSCF) — current **0.01 requests_per_second** vs learned baseline **0.06 requests_per_second** (MEDIUM, drop)
    - **What it measures:** Health of the I-CSCF → S-CSCF forwarding path. Drop to zero while
I-CSCF is receiving REGISTERs = S-CSCF-side issue (crashed, or
I-CSCF → S-CSCF path broken).
    - **Drop means:** S-CSCF isolated or not running.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 0–0.5 requests_per_second
    - **Healthy invariant:** Per-UE rate. Tracks icscf.register rate.

- **`normalized.smf.bearers_per_ue`** (Active QoS bearers per UE) — current **0.00 count** vs learned baseline **2.48 count** (MEDIUM, drop)
    - **What it measures:** Per-UE count of active QoS bearers. Baseline reflects default
bearers; increments during VoNR calls indicate dedicated voice
bearers being set up. Drop during an active call = dedicated
bearer torn down unexpectedly (voice will fail).
    - **Drop means:** Lost bearers. If sustained during a call, voice path is broken.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 2–3.5 count
    - **Healthy invariant:** At rest: equals configured default bearers (typically 2 per UE).
During active VoNR call: +1 per caller. The per-UE ratio is the
invariant; absolute count scales with UE pool.

- **`normalized.smf.sessions_per_ue`** (PDU sessions per attached UE) — current **0.00 count** vs learned baseline **2.00 count** (MEDIUM, drop)
    - **What it measures:** Ratio of established PDU sessions to RAN-attached UEs. Constant under
healthy operation (depends on configured APNs per UE). Drift means
some UEs lost or failed to establish their sessions — usually points
to SMF or UPF control-plane issues, since attachment (ran_ue) is
independent of session establishment.
    - **Drop means:** Some UEs have fewer PDU sessions than they should. Likely SMF or PFCP (N4) issues.
    - **Healthy typical range:** 1.9–2.1 count
    - **Healthy invariant:** Constant equal to configured_apns_per_ue (typically 2). Scale-independent.

### Localized Synthesis

**Verdict:** `localized`  
**Primary suspect NF:** `upf`  
**Confidence:** high

**Summary:** Transport-layer fault localized to upf[eth0]: qdisc_netem reports 458 packets dropped (42.2%).

**Recommendation:** Inspect the traffic control queuing discipline on the UPF container by running: `docker exec upf tc -s qdisc show dev eth0`.

**Diagnosis:**

> ### causes
> - **summary**: Transport-layer fault localized to upf[eth0]: qdisc_netem reports 458 packets dropped (42.2%).
> - **timeline**:
>     1. Path walk initiated for flow `vonr_media` based on transport-layer signals.
>     2. Packet drops (42.2%) attributed to a `qdisc_netem` configuration on hop 5, `upf[eth0]`.
>     3. Path walk concluded, localizing the fault to the UPF container with high confidence.
> - **root_cause**: Kernel-level packet drop on the UPF container's eth0 interface due to a netem queuing discipline configured to introduce 30% packet loss. (primary_suspect_nf: `upf`)
> - **affected_components**:
>     - `upf`: Root Cause
> - **recommendation**: Inspect the traffic control queuing discipline on the UPF container by running: `docker exec upf tc -s qdisc show dev eth0`.
> - **confidence**: high
> - **verdict_kind**: localized
> - **explanation**: A path walk through the transport layer for the `vonr_media` flow definitively localized the fault to the `upf` container. The walk attributed high packet loss directly to a kernel-level mechanism on the `eth0` interface.

### Scoring Breakdown

**Overall score: 100%**

**Scorer assessment:** The agent provided an exceptionally accurate and detailed diagnosis, correctly identifying the root cause, affected component, severity, and fault type, with appropriate confidence and layer attribution.

| Dimension | Result | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Root cause correct | Yes | The agent correctly identified 'Kernel-level packet drop on the UPF container's eth0 interface due to a netem queuing discipline configured to introduce 30% packet loss' as the root cause. This perfectly matches the simulated failure mode of 30% packet loss on the UPF. |
| Component overlap | 100% | The agent correctly identified 'upf' as the 'Root Cause' in the affected_components list, which is the primary affected component in the simulated failure. |
| Severity correct | Yes | The simulated failure involved 30% packet loss leading to degradation. The agent's diagnosis of '42.2% dropped' packets accurately reflects a degradation, not a complete outage, aligning with the actual severity. |
| Fault type identified | Yes | The agent clearly identified 'packet drop' and 'packet loss' as the fault type, which is a correct identification of a network degradation fault. |
| Layer accuracy | Yes | The UPF belongs to the 'core' layer. The agent's 'Classifier Rationale' explicitly mentions 'core.smf' signals, indicating that it correctly considered metrics from the core layer in its analysis, consistent with the UPF being a core component. |
| Confidence calibrated | Yes | The agent stated 'high' confidence, which is appropriate given the highly accurate and detailed diagnosis that precisely matched the simulated failure mode and even identified the injection mechanism. |

**Ranking position:** #1 — The agent provided a single, correct root cause as its primary diagnosis.
